# CodeTest
Demo Project
ASP.Net MVC application.
The application should let the user pick widgets from a given list, enter quantity and state.
When the user clicks calculate button, it should display discount, sales tax and total price.
All Widgets should have a name, base price, and discount indicator (true/false).
Widgets are given a discount of 10% if the discount indicator is true.
The total price of a widget should be determined by adding the base price - discount (if applicable) + tax.
Tax is calculated based on the currently selected state.
All states have a 5% flat tax rate except for TX and FL (which have noÂ  tax rate of 0%).
